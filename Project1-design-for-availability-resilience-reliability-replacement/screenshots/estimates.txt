
In scenarios where an RDS database instance's volumes are compromised and recreation from backups is necessary,
the typical Recovery Point Objective (RPO) across Single-AZ, Multi-AZ, and even scenarios hovers around 5 minutes.
This aligns with the targeted interval for RDS to conduct log backups to S3, signifying a potential loss of 5 minutes of
log data in the event of a database volume loss. In a Single-AZ setup, the sole live copy of data resides in the EBS volume,
and while EBS ensures durability and availability through mirroring, certain situations may necessitate recovery from backups,
establishing the 5-minute log backup interval as a relevant RPO benchmark.

In a Multi-AZ configuration, the likelihood of data loss is significantly diminished due to the maintenance
of a synchronous copy of the volume in a separate data center (AZ). With automatic failover in case of primary instance failure,
Multi-AZ ensures an RTO of 1-2 minutes and an RPO approaching zero, as there is no data loss in common failures.
Even in extreme scenarios like natural disasters impacting the primary data center, the secondary instance seamlessly takes over
with no data loss, justifying the assumption of an RPO of 0.

In the context of a Single AZ outage within a multi-AZ deployment,
synchronous replication and automatic failover contribute to minimal RTO and RPO.
Conversely, in the case of a single region outage within a multi-region deployment,
manual intervention is required to promote the read replica, introducing slightly greater RTO and RPO due to asynchronous replication.
These distinctions highlight the varying levels of automation and replication mechanisms influencing recovery objectives in different
deployment scenarios.
